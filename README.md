# Locale Detector

This Rails gem makes use of the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE http header send by web browsers with every request, to set the `I18n.locale` variable.
When this fails (for example if there is no such http header as is the case for Google bot), it will try to determine the locale based on the toplevel domain suffix (so it will set 'de' for the `example.de` domain).
When both fail, it will fall back to the `LocaleDetector.fallback_locale`, which is 'en' by default and can be overriden in `config/initializers/locale_detector.rb`.


## Installation

Install the gem

```bash
$ gem install locale_detector
```

add it to the Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'locale_detector'
```

and bundle

```bash
$ bundle
```


You can optionally overwrite the default fallback locale by creating a `config/initializers/locale_detector.rb` file and set the `fallback_locale` to a new string, for example:

```ruby
LocaleDetector.fallback_locale = 'pl'
```
